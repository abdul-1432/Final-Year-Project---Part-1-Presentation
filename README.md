# Final Year Project - Part 1 Presentation

## Machine Learning in Finance

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Part 1 Presentation of my final year project on "Machine Learning in Finance." This repository contains the documentation, presentation slides, and a curated list of 25 articles that have been studied as a part of the research.

### Project Overview

In this project, we explore the intersection of machine learning and finance, aiming to leverage advanced algorithms to enhance financial decision-making processes. The project is divided into two parts, and this repository covers the materials related to Part 1, including the foundational research, literature review, and the initial stages of the project.

### Repository Structure

1. **Documentation:** This directory contains detailed documentation outlining the project's objectives, methodologies, and initial findings. It provides insights into the research process and sets the stage for the development phase in Part 2.

2. **Presentation Slides:** The "Slides" directory includes the PowerPoint presentation used during the Part 1 presentation. These slides highlight key aspects of the project, including literature review summaries, methodology, and potential applications.

3. **Articles:** The "Articles" directory houses a curated list of 25 relevant articles that have been thoroughly studied during the research phase. Each article is accompanied by a brief summary, highlighting its significance in the context of machine learning applications in finance.

### Getting Started

To get started with exploring this repository, you can follow these steps:

1. **Documentation:** Navigate to the "Documentation" directory to access detailed information about the project's background, objectives, and the research methodology employed.

2. **Presentation Slides:** Head to the "Slides" directory to review the PowerPoint presentation used during the Part 1 presentation. This will provide an overview of the key concepts discussed in the project.

3. **Articles:** Visit the "Articles" directory to access the curated list of 25 articles. Each article is accompanied by a summary, helping you understand the insights gained from the literature review.

### Future Work

Part 2 of the project will focus on the practical implementation of machine learning models in the finance domain. Stay tuned for updates and additional materials as the project progresses.
